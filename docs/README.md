# QuaCa {docsify-ignore-all}
**QuaCa** stands for Quantum / Casimir Friction and is a numerical framework to calculate just that.

## Dependencies
QuaCa requires:

* [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/): integration routines
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/): file parser and file handling
* [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/) and [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/): fast linear algebra

Furthermore we use:
* [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/): wrapper for linear algebra (uses LAPACK and BLAS)
* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2): unit testing
* [docsify](https://docsify.js.org): documentation

## Installing
To obtain the source code type into the console
```bash
git clone git@git.physik.hu-berlin.de:top/codeprojects/quaca.git
```

Then to build the code type inside the project directory
```bash
quaca $ mkdir -p build
quaca $ cd build
quaca/build $ cmake ..
quaca/build $ make quaca
```

An executable called `quaca` should now have been build and can be found in the `quaca/bin` directory.

## Documentation
The documentation can either be accessed [here](https://quacateam.github.io/quaca/) or be viewed locally using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) by
```
quaca $ cd docs && python3 -m http.server 3000
```
or [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) by
```
quaca $ cd docs && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```
You can then view the documentation in your browser at the adress `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Testing
We follow a test-driven development style and are currently using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for our testing.
We split our tests into unit tests, which test the consistency of individual classes and functions, and integrated tests
which test the interplay of classes and functions.
To run tests, build the tests first with
```
quaca/build $ make test_quaca_unit test_quaca_integrated
```
then run the tests from the `bin/` directory
```
quaca/bin $ ./test_quaca_unit
quaca/bin $ ./test_quaca_integrated
```
More detailled information is given in the section [Testing](dev/testing.md).
